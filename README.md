## What We Learned : Creating a pull request on Github
- (1) Fork the repository: Start by forking the repository that needs contribution.
- (2) Clone the forked repository to the local machine. 
  ```
  git clone <forked repository URL>
  ```
- (3) Create a new branch before making any changes to the code
  ```
  git checkout -b <new branch name>
  ```
- (4) Commit changes
  ```
  git add <file name>
  git commit -m "<commit message>"
  ```
- (5) Push the changes to the forked repository.
  ```
  git push origin <new branch name>
  ```
- (6) Go to the forked repository on GitHub and switch to the new branch.
- (7) click on the "New pull request" button.
- (8) The repository owner can review the changes and decide whether or not to merge them into the main codebase.
